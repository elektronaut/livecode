= Livecode

Livecoding toolkit for Ruby. Primarily intended for Textmate on OSX, but the server should work on any *nix variant.

More to come.

== Installation

First, install the gem:

 gem install livecode

== Usage

Once you're set up, fire up the server:

 livecode_server run

== Connecting to the Livecode server

 require 'livecode_server'
 client = LivecodeServer::Client.new

You can now send code to the server:

 client.run 'message = "Hello world!"'
 client.run 'puts message'
